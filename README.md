# :arrows_counterclockwise: Reverse interview questions for Software Engineers

Questions **you** should ask when interviewed for a Software Engineering position.

## Why ask these questions during an interview?

As a Software Engineer, you will go through several interviews in your carreer.
These interviews are typically set up by the potential employers to evaluate your **cultural**
**and technical fitness** for the role.
<br>
From the candidate's point of view, the interview process should not just be about
convincing the employer. That is of course important, however, it should not be your *primary*
concern unless you are in *dire* need for a job.
Instead, you should mainly aim to understand what the company works with, how your future team
mates operate, what would your development be and so on.
<br>
In other words, you should strive to collect the necessary information which will allow **you**
to assess the technical and cultural suitability of the workplace, its tech and the people in it.

This is what lead me to create a set of *reverse* interview questions.
<br>
It is tailored for *product companies* and, nonetheless, should be adjusted depending on the setting
as well as common sense.
Do not try to blindly follow it irrespective of the flow of the conversation, it will just be awkward.
Usually, the interviewer will ask you if you have any questions. This is your chance to start with them,
taking into consideration what has already been discussed.
No need to ask all of them, or in a particular order either. The context matters!
<br>
Most, if not all, questions are open-ended and **there is no "correct" answer**.
More precisely, it is up to you to determine whether the responses satisfy you or not.
They are also best-addressed towards individuals involved with development. Do not ask them to an
human resources representative or a recruiter. Furthermore, topics that should be covered in every interview,
such as benefit packages, working hours salary etc, are not included.

Overall, personal experience shows these questions make it easier for the interviewers to illustrate
in depth what and how they work with. Thus far, they have been warmly welcomed and even helped to
make a good impression. To say the least, they show the candidate is highly interested and seriously
engaged with the process.
<br>
More importantly they enable you, as a Software Engineer, make well-informed carreer decisions.

## Way of Working

| Question(s)                                                                                                     | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Before a team member starts working on a task, what preparatory work has taken place and what occurs after?** | Is the task is written down in some tool and who writes it? Are the tasks derived from a certain set of requirements? Who maintains those requirements? How is traceability ensured? How does the code get peer reviewed?                                                             |
| **Do you have a specific workstation setup in regards to the operating system, the IDE etc?**                   | In some projects there is a very well-defined toolset, either due to company guidelines or constraints set by the product domain. Others let developers freely select their own. The latter is not always the better choice since it may be trickier to set up an efficient workflow. |
| **Do you use any containers for your development environment and/or the product?**                              | Using containers make it easier to get all necessary dependencies, however, may be less flexible.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Do you do pair programming?**                                                                                 | Some like pair-programming, some do not. Eitherhow, it is something good to know in advance.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **How do you ensure knowledge sharing?**                                                                        | Knowledge sharing is important and there are different ways to do it, which may or may not suit you.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Are there usually person-specific tasks or can everything be taken up by anyone?**                            | This is one of the most important questions for me. I strongly prefer when everyone can potentially take up any task in the team. However, others like to go deep and specialize in particular sub-domains.                                                                           |
| **How do you write documentation?**                                                                             | Do they maintain separate documents, is it contained in the code or is everything self-documenting so there is no need for extra documentation?                                                                                                                                       |
| **How do you work with bugs?**                                                                                  | What happens after a bug is discovered? Who usually reports them? How does the emergence of a bug affect their planning?                                                                                                                                                              |
| **How do you collaborate with other sites?**                                                                    | It is often fun to work with colleagues located in different parts of the world, however this does come with its set of challenges.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **When developing a feature, is the team able to complete it in its entirety?**                                 | This will give you a hint on the *size* of the system you will be working with as well as how *vertical* the team's domain of responsibility is.                                                                                                                                      |

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Are you working with open source software? If so, how?** | Can they name some open source packages they heavily utilize? Do they upstream any changes? Working with open source can be a valuable experience to carry with to the next job and upstreamed changes offer great visibility. On the other hand, there may be multiple do's and don'ts which can make your life difficult. |

## Relations with customers

| **Who and how comes up with novel features?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Does the responsibility for comming up with new features lie with the customer or the company's higher management? Is there an "advanced engineering" team that is tasked with this? Do the employees themselves often propose novel product functionality? Or is it interns that get to experiment with the fun stuff?                   |
| **What kind of functionality are you mostly working with in this branch?**<br><ul><li>**Commodity** functionality constitutes all functionality that customers typically expect in a product or system, but that is also offered by competing companies.</li><li>**Differentiating** functionality contains the functionality that makes customers select our products or systems over those from competitors.</li><li>**Innovation** functionality is experimental functionality. Company experiments with different innovative ideas in order to identify new future differentiation.</li></ul> | The three types of functionality are taken from Jan Bosch's 3LPM.
